# AnchorFact Public Content Audit - 2026-05-28

Generated: 2026-05-28T12:10:31.681Z

Snapshot: 555 public / 445 draft / 1658 claims.

## Summary

This is a risk-weighted audit sample of public AnchorFact articles. It is intended to calibrate quality rules before changing publication eligibility.

- Sample size: 20
- Low verified coverage samples: 1
- Articles with at least one fail check: 0
- High-confidence samples needing review: 0
- Claim-evidence failures: 0
- Recommendations: keep_public: 11, downgrade_confidence: 0, repair_sources: 9, move_to_draft: 0

## Method

The sample is selected from public manifest entries only. Buckets are fixed at 8 low-coverage public entries, 4 high-confidence entries, 4 medium entries with capped claims, and 4 low-confidence public entries. Entries are de-duplicated by canonical slug.

## Rule Calibration

- Keep `low_verified_coverage` as an audit marker until a larger sample confirms the failure rate.
- Keep the current high-confidence rule, while continuing spot checks.
- Keep exporting claims with confidence caps, but continue auditing weak evidence.

## Next Manual Review

For each article marked `repair_sources` or `move_to_draft`, manually inspect the linked source pages before changing content. Do not bulk edit unsampled articles from this report alone.
